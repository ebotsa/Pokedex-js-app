# Pokedex-js-app
Hello, this is my very first API application.
The purpose of this project was to build a simple application; listing a variety of Pokemon along with their individual attributes; sourcing the information directly from an external API.
The app has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.<br>
Key Features include: <br>
Load data from an external source (API) <br>
View a list of items <br>
On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item<br>
Requirements:
The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API. <br>
The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.<br> 
The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on demand, such as when clicking on a list item.<br> 
The app must have CSS styling. <br>
The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules. <br>
The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier. ○ The JavaScript code may be manually formatted. <br>
The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or touch interactions. ○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon). <br>
The app must not throw any errors when being used.<br> 
The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, & Web Hosting). <br>
The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
